I'm a young male adult in his mid-twenties. I used to play a lot of Nintendo games (I owned a GBC and a Gamecube) and be a little fanboy that (mild-mannerly) praised games on my system that I'd never played and trashed rival stuff. I'd say I'm somewhat past that now. 

I particularly like the 98-05 period of games. Partly because I grew up with some of them, but also because AAA still had a lot of wild creativity (how niche games like Giants : Citizen Kabuto got to be sold I'm still unsure about), sprawling level designs that didn't feel overengineered, messing around with fairly advanced 3D without being uncanny-valleyish. Things started going very downhill after that, in my somewhat limited and biased opinion.

I grew up and live in Europe, and am bilingual (hence the French and English reviews you'll find on this site). This site will mostly be about videogames, for now, anyway.

### Friends and interesting reviewers

From what I can tell, most game reviewers are drab, conformist, and uninteresting, following popular expectations and potentially making their minds up about a game before even having played it.

Here are a few reviewers don't follow that trend whose articles and work I particularly enjoy reading :

- Tevis Thompson (http://tevisthompson.com/), who has written long noteworthy posts about the state of game reviewing,
- Jed Pressgrove (https://gamebias.wordpress.com/),
- Joel Goodwin (http://www.electrondance.com/, has made some excellent short films on various topics, such as No Man's Sky, or the joy of exploration in video games, which you can view on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHarbourMaster)).

Here are a few Youtube channels with interesting content :
- The channel with the 'Ross's Game Dungeon' series (https://www.youtube.com/user/chilledsanity),
- Errant Signal (https://www.youtube.com/user/Campster),
- Curly Brace (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcLI-JPNerzN4fiqZlbIlw).

And here are a few personal friends who also write interesting game reviews. Their creativity and flourish in their prose are far more refined than mine. It's all in French though.
- Maratz (https://nicolasmoisson.fr/ecrits),
- Oriane (https://oriane.ink/critique/notes/jeu).

### Contact me

Uuuh, I dunno if I want random people to contact me. Maybe I'll set something up at some point.
