I'm a young male adult in his mid-twenties. I used to play a lot of Nintendo games (I owned a GBC and a Gamecube) and be a little fanboy that (mild-mannerly) praised games on my system that I'd never played and trashed rival stuff. I'd say I'm somewhat past that now. 

I particularly like the 1998-2005 period of games. Partly because I grew up playing some of them, but also because AAA still had a lot of wild creativity (I'm still unsure know how niche games like Giants : Citizen Kabuto ended up being made), sprawling level designs that didn't feel over-engineered, messing around with fairly advanced 3D without being uncanny-valleyish. Compared to the previous generation, complex worlds could be fleshed out without too many draw distance and polygon count issues, yet still leave much for the player's imagination to fill in. Things started going very downhill after that, in my somewhat limited and biased opinion.

I grew up and live in Europe, and am bilingual (hence the French and English reviews you'll find on this site). This site will mostly be about videogames, for now, anyway.

### Interesting game critics

From what I can tell, most game reviewers are drab, conformist, and uninteresting, following popular expectations and potentially making their minds up about a game before even having played it. 

Here are a few reviewers don't follow that trend whose articles and work I particularly enjoy reading :

- [Tevis Thompson](http://tevisthompson.com/), who has written long noteworthy posts about the state of game reviewing,
- [Jed Pressgrove](https://gamebias.wordpress.com/),
- [Joel Goodwin](http://www.electrondance.com/, has made some excellent short films on various topics, such as No Man's Sky, or the joy of exploration in video games, which you can view on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHarbourMaster)).

Here are a few Youtube channels with interesting content :
- [The channel with the 'Ross's Game Dungeon' series](https://www.youtube.com/user/chilledsanity),
- [Errant Signal](https://www.youtube.com/user/Campster),
- [Curly Brace](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcLI-JPNerzN4fiqZlbIlw).

And here are a few personal friends who also write interesting game reviews. Their creativity and flourish in their prose are far more refined than mine. It's all in French though.

### Contact me

Uuuh, I dunno if I want random people to contact me. Maybe I'll set something up at some point.
