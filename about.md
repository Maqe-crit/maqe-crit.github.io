I'm a young male adult in his mid-twenties. I used to play a lot of Nintendo games (I owned a GBC and a Gamecube) and be a little fanboy that (mild-mannerly) praised games on my system that I'd never played and trashed rival stuff. I'd say I'm somewhat past that now. 

I particularly like the 98-05 period of games. Partly because I grew up with some of them, but also because AAA still had a lot of wild creativity (how niche games like Giants : Citizen Kabuto got to be sold I'm still unsure about), sprawling level designs that didn't feel overengineered, messing around with fairly advanced 3D without being uncanny-valleyish. Things started going very downhill after that, in my somewhat limited and biased opinion.

I grew up and live in Europe, and am bilingual (hence the French and English reviews you'll find on this site). This site will mostly be about videogames, for now, anyway.

### Friends and interesting reviewers

From what I can tell, most game reviewers are drab, conformist, and uninteresting, following popular expectations and potentially making their minds up about a game before even having played it.

Here are a few reviewers don't follow that trend whose articles and work I particularly enjoy reading :

- Tevis Thompson,
- Jed Pressgrove,
- Joel Goodwin (Electron Dance, has made some excellent short films on various topics, such as No Man's Sky, or the joy of exploration in video games, which you can view on youtube).

Here are a few Youtube channels with interesting content :
- Ross's Game Dungeon,
- Errant Signal,
- Curly Brace.

And here are a few personal friends who also write interesting game reviews. Their creativity and flourish in their prose are far more refined than mine. It's in French though.

Uuuh, I dunno if I want random people to contact me. Maybe I'll set something up at some point.
