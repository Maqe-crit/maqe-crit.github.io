Bought that one on a whim.

Heard it was buggy and clunky, which intrigued me. Its place in the Matrix saga also makes it a cultural oddity.

It's supposed to fill a few blanks between Reloaded and Revolutions, and explains some of the events that occurred while Trinity/Morpheus/Neo were busy blowing stuff up.

You play as Niobe, or Ghost (her second-in-command).

The game has about ten levels, each divided into a few zones. There are a few vehicle sequences (if playing a Niobe, you drive around, whereas Ghost shoots at stuff).

My general impression of the game is akin to how I feel when gazing at the title screen (which zooms in with the well-known font effect, the degraded quality is very noticeable though). An ambitious game, that did pull me back into the films' universe, but unfinished, and that in some ways was hampered by the consoles it was released on.

The story hooked me in almost immediately. Familiar faces pop up, and the new plot points aren't all filler. They do add more context to the overaching narrative, and I learned a little more about Niobe, and her relationship with the commander, for instance.

If you're a fan of the series, these cutscenes and this extra insight will probably make playing this worthwhile. I wonder if the fact that chunks of story were delegated (relegated ?) to this game or to Animatrix didn't also contribute to the fact that people didn't appreciate Reloaded and Revolutions as much. 

The Merovingian's castle, the power plant that Niobe blows up in Reloaded, ... Familiar places. A familiar sountrack, with some pieces present in the film soundtracks. The familiar font, special effects, bullet time and odd physics of the matrix. This doesn't steer too far from the films.

Interestingly, I feel the Matrix universe is capable of making a smooth transition to videogames. Well, a certain kind of videogame, anyway. Car chases, fights, stuff blowing up, running all over the place... Bullet time to dodge bullets. Its unusual physics and flexible architecture enable it to steer around uncanny valley for its character movement (the more limited graphics of that generation of console also help) and provide non-realistic level structures without any inconsistencies. 

The excess of long corridors isn't out of place in this videogame adaptation, and doesn't clash with the atmosphere of the films. The sound design is also very faithful to the weightless gravity of the Matrix. Sometimes, impacts feel soft, light taps rather than bonecrushing crunches.

The game isn't very pretty. Every character is recognisable, and some look very much like their film counterpart, but it could have been better. The car chase sequences lack polygons.

A lot of work was put into animating these characters, though. The motion capture team must have put in a lot of hours. Many of the films' iconic moves are also readily available here (dives in bullet time, backflips, running on walls, some of the one-two hit combos ...). The running animation (which is faster if you aren't holding a weapon) is instantly reminescent of running sequences in the film. The in-game cutscenes (not the cutscenes shot with the actors for the purposes of this game) aren't too clean, though, and probably didn't have any motion capture. Climbing ladders also feels decidedly jittery. 

A lot of modern FPS tropes were already present in this game. Objectives onscreen, regenerating HP, a bullet time gauge, and sometimes a little arrow pointing in the direction of the objective.

I don't usually like them, but again, here, they can be consistent with the Matrix universe. Niobe's operator can send her instructions, and he has access to building floor plans and can view the scenery from above. The arrow pointing towards an objective is only present during car chases, thankfully.

There's also a sort of hacking minigame, which helps unlock some unusually interesting bonuses in the main menu. It fits to the theme and visual design, I think it's a nice touch.

Many concessions had to be made, though.

Some of the scenes that were shot are short, and some dialogue feels terse or forced, cut short.

Some levels were long and tedious. There's a long sequence in the sewers, with dark areas, really convoluted level design, enemies you need to squint so as to spot them, and clunky platforming. The driving sequences are also a little dark, and feel empty and limited. They certainly aren't highlights.

I didn't encounter any major bugs (I'd hoped I might get a few chuckles out of any uncanny glitches I might come across), but there were some other niggles.

The camera was a little capricious here and there, and doesn't instantly focus on targeted items, or on those that could interest the player.

The fighting mechanics are very complex. One can kick, punch, grab, dodge/counterattack, use a gun, dive, backflip, and bullet time adds to the complexity. With the camera issues, and some of the moveset displacing the character slightly, I found myself plummetting to a demise several times.

The game is very unpolished, and feels incomplete, at times.

It's not quite smooth. Difficulty spikes abound, enemies all require a few hits, stopping you in your tracks every time, and the minor bugs are an occasional nuisance.

The times where it all came together and felt like Matrix were scarce. There were a few (I realised in an area with destructible environment that the combos were more complex than I had initially thought, making subsequent duels very pleasant, with some clean bullet time action), and the game felt like an amazing glimpse of a promising future. But, too few.

Highly ambitious, but it falls short. Not flat, but short. 

It made me fantasise about what it could have been, rather than appreciate it for what it is. What it is, is an unfulfilled but highly, uh, promising, promise, marred by a lack of spit, and technical limitations.

I feel like if there were a remake of this now, it could be closer to what the Wachowski sisters had envisioned back then. I wouldn't trust a AAA dev team not to muck this up, though, and it's not like the actors haven't aged, so shooting the same scenes more than fifteen years later sounds like a bad idea. Too bad, but I'm ok with the occasional daydream about my perfect Enter the Matrix game.
