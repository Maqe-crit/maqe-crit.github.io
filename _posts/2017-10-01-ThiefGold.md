Note : If you buy this game, I highly recommend using the TFix patch, it makes massive improvements.

Subtlety wasn't commonplace in first-person 90's games. Only a select few (such as Strife) had a story with people you didn't have to shoot.

Thief : The Dark Project is a first-person game that is not a first-person game about shooting people.

I played the Gold version, which added some content and changed a few levels.

The game is a bit rough on the edges. I'm fine with PS2-era 3D, but this predates it by a few years. Character models are not very expressive, and very blocky. 

Garrett, a shady city dweller (in a, hmm, medievaley-steampunkey-fantasy universe) who appears to make a living by fencing valuable items he plunders in rich mansions and the like.

The tutorial is optional. That's neat.

The first level is relatively basic. He says it at the start, too. "A nice, simple job."

I really appreciate how the game stays rather vague in terms of our character's capabilities and skillset. Whether it be the level design, enemy AI, or Garrett's toolset, it's up to the player to understand and experiment.

You have access to all your tools from the get-go, limited only by your budget, keyboard skills, and understanding. After all, Garrett is an accomplished thief, he isn't some level 1 rookie slaughtering sheep on a quest to save the world.

This is an infiltration game. Stealth and shit. Garrett is much punier than your favourite AAA souped-up testosterone hunk of muscle. Combat is deliberately awkward and clunky. A drawn sword considerably hampers your movement. He's much more agile when it's sheathed. 

Two whacks from a guard in the belly and you're history. Far better to stay in the shadows. Guards hunt you down, too. Remaining undetected is ideal, and it's less messy, anyway. And you can't win every fight by bashing someone wildly on the head with your sword. Other guards will come. They will hunt you down. 

The bow isn't a semi-automatic weapon. Ammo is limited. 

Thief doesn't hold your hand. No omniscient map, no way to track your enemies, no absurd MGS cardboard box. No no no. Forget all of that.

Garrett is a thief. He's not a superhuman. If he's never been somewhere, hasn't scouted out his next plunder location, he won't know the layout, and neither will you. He might have a map of the area, which may be incorrect or incomplete. It's up to you to understand the layout and to memorise it. You have to explore, understand, and slowly make your way through these mostly unknown locations.

Limited ammo means you have to choose. Your tools are huge boons, they can be lifesavers when used properly, but again, you're a thief, not geared for combat. You have to know when to use them and when to keep them for when they really matter.

The game is not easy. Get spotted in the wrong area and you're probably not going to make it. Overcoming one enemy is feasible, two is most of the time going to be too much for Garrett. You can save anytime, and if you're able to outrun them, guards may stop chasing after a fairly long time, but you can't slip up too much.

This might feel frustrating to players used to a constant state of flow, empowering mechanics, regenerating health, maps and objective markers, and very combat-able player characters. And hurr durr this game looks like shit what is this, pre-2000 ? What ? I'm not playing this shit it's outdated.

The game has certainly aged.

However, I believe that it's far from outdated. 

Let's talk about the universe. I vaguely mentioned it's medievaley-steampunkey-fantasy.

The game doesn't bother giving you many details. Context is provided between levels, but only insofar as Garrett needs to know. You might learn more through observation, or reading through letters you pick up, or by eavesdropping on some conversation.

There are a few factions that Garrett gets to 'interact with' throughout the game (The Order of The Hammer, religious fanatics, or the Templars, whom Garrett already knows). 

But Garrett is already well-versed with all of that. There's no reason for him to start explaining things out loud.

I understood that there was more to this medieval universe than I thought when I came across an electric lamp. There's more advanced technology ? No one told me about that. 

There are no signs indicating where secret passages lie, there's no key to highlight interactive objects. Shoddy game design workarounds to problems that can be solved with better level layout, and design. 

The tutorial only teaches you the minimum basics. You learn how to make the most out of your toolset organically, by listening, watching, thinking. And waiting. The water arrow can put out fires and torches. Will it work on electric lamps ? Oh, woops, nope, of course it won't. Makes sense. No need for an immersion-ruining and patronising message. No, here you explore and try things out. This game respects you.

Such a breath of fresh air. 

In more recent games, designers would have gone to great lengths and fallen all over each other to justify all of their crap, sacrificing consistency in the process. There'd have been popup-text, or maybe some forced tepid conversation between NPCs. Or maybe you'd come across a letter explaining more or less how electricity works in some thief's drawers and how electric lamps were first built a hundred years ago.

Think, for instance, Dishonored. Every steampunk element of that game is explained. Descriptive papers are everywhere, detailing random things for no reason. If I recall correctly, there's a paper in a bar drawer explaining how and why the city focused on whaling. It makes no sense. It also removes some of the exploration from the player, and doesn't leave anything to their imagination (and ultimately leaves us with a hollow world).

None of that crap here. Garrett understands the universe he lives in. He's not going to start rambling out loud (he doesn't really talk that much, either). The player will notice things as they go along, and can also piece some things together. But none of that player-centric exposition bullshit. This is so important to me. It made Thief several times more immersive and feel much more consistent and believable than Dishonored ever did. 

Besides, many things still remain fuzzy and unclear. Again, it's not like Garrett is omniscient. He expresses his uncertainty several times. So an atmosphere filled with intrigue and mystery lingers throughout
the whole game. It feels cold, sometimes eerie and austere, in a good way. What the player is shown is consistent, and the rest if left to the imagination.

Darkness is your friend in this game. Almost your only friend. Most of the beings Garrett encounters are at best indifferent to your presence ; generally they're hostile. We're constantly reminded of our aloneness and vulnerability. No one is going to help you, and you're in a deep mansion full of people who'll hunt you down if they spot you. The shadows provide hope, and respite. They are bastions of darkness amidst the brightness that feels like it strips you naked, leaves you exposed and defenseless.

You feel alone, and very, very conspicuous and vulnerable, when you have to walk across a long, electronically-lit, marble corridor.

(Floor surfaces have different sound output. Carpet is soft, accomodating and agreeable. Marble will make you sweat. There's no way someone won't hear my footsteps. Fuck).

If you're able to get into it, Thief is incredibly gripping. It's exquisite. Tense, ominous, horrific, at times. Stressful.

Garrett is his own character, and the player might not identify with him, but he mostly fades away during gameplay, and it is the player who experiences the game. You see the world through his eyes, but *you* were the one that guard spotted. 

Getting proficient at being stealthy has its pirks. There's something viscerally satisfying about dodging some guard at the last moment after having mucked about. Adrenaline and dopamine. The skilled player is empowered, and feels free, but will still take considerable risks. One big misstep, and you're still dead meat. You're always aware that you're but a human. One that treads softly, perhaps, but not one that can outrun five guards.

The level design is fantastic. Levels felt very well-designed. Their layout is complex, and requires navigation, and memorisation. No game design shortcuts. No random junk. No powerups. Plunder to be plundered, light, darkness. Beings that are best avoided. 

You feel free in this game. Free to take risks, to look, perhaps, for another way. Free to press forward at your own pace. Free and limited as a thief. 

I thought the levels might start growing stale after a while. Manors and castles, initially. Will it become repetitive ?

Not so. Some levels have a radically different layout and design. Consistently with the universe. I was surprised more than once by what lay in front of my eyes. The game has no qualms with occasionally screwing with the player.

The levels speak to you. They speak to you through their layout, and through the way you may be able to move through them. This makes these places feel *real*. You understand them. You don't sleepwalk through them. They aren't decor. They respond.

The game's atmosphere gives me shivers. Angst, curiosity, mystery, sometimes horror, sometimes wonder. No music during gameplay. Instead, I listen to the world. My own footsteps are pounding in my ears. Hearing someone else's stops me dead in my tracks, a growing knot in my stomach. NPCs aren't binary alert/patrol state machines either. You need to infer how they are responding to you.

Was that too loud ? Did he hear something or did he hear *me* ? Should I keep walking ?

Even the story was alright. It's not too present, and preserves the shroud of mystery and foreigness of the Thief universe.

It has aged a little though, undeniably.

Enemies often say out loud what they are thinking ("Muh. I guess he's gone"), to help make their behaviour clearer. This is a imperfect workaround around a problem that I feel is due to technical limitations of the time (enemies can't be expressive enough for the player to infer their behaviour without any help). Many many more recent stealth games have kept this workaround and failed to address the actual issue. Many of those games haven't really been that much of a step forward (if at all).

The AI has its limits -mostly, again, due to limitations of the time- and its exploits, which sometimes turned out to be the 'easier' way forward. I chickened out a bit. I think playing this game on hard mode (no casualties allowed, pretty much, and a few other additional constraints) is likely an even more interesting experience, and I didn't play the game that way. I wouldn't have been able to get by with those occasional AI exploits, in any case.

There are mods of this game. The Dark Mod, using the Doom 3 engine, might also be worth checking out if you can't get enough of the gameplay.

I think this game is great. It was significant, and still holds up very well today. Perhaps part of the reason it holds up so well today is because more recent stealth games have taken the wrong direction with the genre, both in terms of world-building and mechanics (player-empowering Dishonored, MGS come to mind).

I really liked [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPqwDGXxLhU) comparing 1998 Thief to the 2013 one, and the very different stealth game design philosophies prevalent in both of them. I mostly agree with the narrator's points. I much prefer an incomplete map (makes sense) that requires me to understand the space I'm going through rather than follow some dumb arrow.
