The game throws you almost right in. There's a very short intro (with old 3D and video rendering which I find quite appealing) and that's it. You're barely given any time to find your bearings, and the interface is overwhelming at the start.

You're a hacker lost in a space station he doesn't know, which has been taken over by a rogue AI.

What immediately struck me were the controls. Clunky, old-school, very different from today's consensus, they initially perturbed me (and I'm not sure whether the Enhanced Edition of System Shock haven't already improved on the original). I was still occasionally fumbling with them several hours in.

It's an FPS, with different weapons for different enemies. Some items. Some upgrades to the cybernetic enhancements the hacker obtained (such as a lamp, a shield, or a sort of rear-view mirror). They deplete an energy bar over time.

Some sequences take place in a virtual world known as cyberspace, with freeform 3D movement.

It's dated. Most items are sprites (I think that has its charm though).

The story is interesting. There are only a handful of cutscenes, the intro being one of them. The player has to piece together what happened, for the rest. E-mails, audio logs... Those tell the tale. Direct communication is very rare. 

This was probably a way to circumvent technical limitations of the time, but it also reinforces the feeling of loneliness and discomfort the setting provides. You're lost, you're nearly screwed. No one is going to help you. You'll have to do things by yourself.

This is where the game still shines, twenty years later. You slowly press forward, snoop around, start feeling anxious when you hear a cyborg. Once the threat is dealt with, exploration begins anew. The labyrinthian architecture of the space station (again, perhaps partly due to technical constraints) also reinforces the anxiety or confusion the player might feel.

I liked the storytelling. The partial picture I was able to piece together also made we wonder about the space station before the game's events, before Shodan went haywire.

The gameplay is somewhat basic, but the exploration and RPG-ish mechanics blend in well with the shooter controls.

The game hasn't aged as well as others, though, undeniably.

Its limited gameplay (in terms of situations one can encounter, enemy behaviour, and so on) mean that difficulty can't really be adjusted easily, and some situations felt a little artificial. Some of the voice acting is not up to today's standards.

And Shodan feels too reckless. It (she ?) taunts me, reveals its intentions. It might have been able to squash me like a bug, but instead inadvertently helped me forge a plan. Too human, in some ways, perhaps ?

Enemy AI is very very basic. Although the atmosphere is great, it's hard to be contantly worried about them when they don't chase you, don't really spot you very easily, and can sometimes be cheaply taken down from a distance. The sequel was a major improvement there. Enemies run you down. They seemingly pop up in unexpected areas, catching you offguard and keeping you guessing. The first one wasn't like that. Caution, not playing fair and AI abuse could keep you safer than what 2 allows.

It still feels somewhat relevant, though. It holds up to a certain extent. Being alone in a hostile space station is still chilling and disquieting. The station felt like a place, too, thanks to the logs, emails, and bodies. It's huge, has a consistent layout, and had what felt like people.

The setting is probably overused to death by now, but after playing this game I can understand the appeal.
