Curious title.

VA-11 Hall-A : Cyberpunk Bartender Action

<!--more-->

I haven't played many visual novels (apart from the Phoenix Wright novels, that are a little different, and since then, Ladykiller in a Bind and the excellent Butterfly Soup).

It takes place in the year 207X, in a city in a cyberpunk universe where cybernetic modifications are commonplace, dogs can talk and cyborgs live among humans, ruled by an authoritarian government that is aided by several groups of militia.

We play as Jill, a bartender in the bar VA-11 HALL-A, or Valhalla. When she's at work she serves beverages and chats with the various clients that pop in and out. She then goes home, and we get to do a couple of small tasks before leaving for the next working day.

The gameplay is very basic. Mix drinks, mostly. A bartender's work, repetitive without -hopefully- quite becoming monotonous or predictable.

The game's trailer intrigued me (I generally intensely dislike film and game trailers). The synthwave music, the beautiful pixel art with some slight anime touches here and there, the purple-blue neon lights, a cyberpunk universe borrowing some 80's aesthetics. Looks nice.

The story and dialogs are well written. Every character oozes with, uh, character, to the brim, and they feel genuine, and don't devolve into any clich√©s (although, perhaps the light anime feel occasionally allows for some implicit overemphasis on some personality traits).

The story feels mature and adult. Some of the best dialog I've read in the past couple of years or so. People talk about a lot of things in bars, casually, matter-of-factly, even. This city has a few scars and underlying issues. Mentioned topics include cyborg prostitution, potential deviations of journalism, the hardships of being an honest member of an otherwise corrupt militia brigade, how the assassin profession affects the psyche... and the chats that broach these topics and the way the discussions happen all feel like the kind of thing you might hear in a bar in this universe.

One doesn't get to know the city, outside of Jill's flat, and discussions at the bar. The more characters allude to ongoing events, or other elements of that universe, during discussions, the more intrigued I am and the more I want to get to know them. There's no bullshit, no pedantry, none of it is about me. Jill is the one responding.

As simple as it was, the gameplay ended up surprising me. Jill does impact on some of the events, in her own way and with her own tools. I didn't notice this at first, and like the way I wasn't told about it. 

I felt like a barlady, living her day-to-day life, filled with cocktails, chats with clients and other employees of the bar, with my latent aspirations, frustrations and heartache. Focused relaxation, quiet patient attention directed at clients, friendly and genuine banter with most of them. 

I think the game trailer probably shows just the right amount and hints at just enough more without lying about its premise or pretending to be more amazing than it is. 

It's a little like a nice cocktail and a casual but thought-provoking, friendly, relaxed discussion with a friendly bartender, I suppose.
